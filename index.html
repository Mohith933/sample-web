<p>Here we see the example of kelper-1649c there the structure of 1649c is quite diffrent to earth but it not have humans and plants only 
have mountains etc here we explore all detail 
in explore tab then you can read more
here we can see how the planet is during life time  as well as inside of structures like core,mantal,and emf and outside of solar wind and how it survive until the dead planet</p>
<br><br><br><br>
<h1>Here we see the all galaxies and their
planets and their solar system</h1>
<center>
<img src="way.jpg" height="250">

<p>Here we see the galaxy example of human live in earth the earth are live in solor system the solor system in live in galaxy so the milky way the inside the solor system the only living planet is earth because the earth only survive even hot condition due to EMF only it can surivive if you want detail go to through explore</p>

Eve carried Unity high into the New Mexico skies, ultimately releasing the space plane at 12:10 p.m. EDT (1610 GMT) at an altitude of 44,341 feet (13,515 meters), according to Virgin Galactic. Unity then fired up its onboard rocket motor, powering its way to suborbital space and attaining a top speed of Mach 2.95 — nearly three times the speed of sound — along the way.

Salim and her fellow space tourist customers — British advertising executive Trevor Beattie and American astronomy educator Ron Rosano — got to experience .

The moon may turn out to be more habitable and perhaps hospitable to human life, than what we had earlier believed. This revelation comes to us courtesy of the data that ISRO’s Chandrayaan-3 has collected so far.Ever since the Vikram lander made its historic touchdown on the lunar surface, a constant stream of data and information has been pouring in from both the lander and the rover. A rudimentary analysis of the data, as per experts, shows that the Moon is much more capable of hosting life, and perhaps even a human colony, than what we have believed so far.

As if they were trying to make Star Trek a reality, a bunch of scientists at the University of Colorado, Boulder, have been working on a device that would enable them to shoot “tractor beams.” Tractor beams are fictional technology commonly depicted in science fiction literature, films, and television shows, and have the ability to emit magnetic force and push or pull objects away from their positions, without coming into contact with them.

Initial designs show promise
The researchers’ early design concepts are generating excitement as they show promising results. </p>
